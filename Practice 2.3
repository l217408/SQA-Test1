Text of practice exercises for Module 2.3:

1.	The first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star has been taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. 
a.	Fatima – NASA’s Hubble Telescope took the first visible-light snapshot of a planet revolving another star.
b.	C - NASA’s Hubble Telescope has taken the first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star.

2.	Therefore, the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are not different was rejected.
a.	Fatima – Therefore, the rejected hypothesis which was rejected states that the kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter are similar.
b.	C – We rejected the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are comparable.
